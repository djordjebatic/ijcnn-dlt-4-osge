## Call for Tutorials
We are pleased to invite researchers and practitioners from around the world to submit proposals for tutorials to be held at the workshop on “Deep Learning Techniques for Observable Smart Grid and Sustainable Energy Systems (DLT-4-OSGE)” during the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN25). 
Workshop Overview: The DLT-4-OSGE workshop aims to bring together experts in the field of deep learning, smart grids, and sustainable energy systems to share their knowledge and insights. The focus will be on innovative deep learning techniques that enhance the observability, efficiency, and sustainability of smart grid systems. 

## Topics of Interest

We welcome tutorial proposals on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to: 
* Deep learning algorithms for smart grid monitoring and control 
* Data-driven approaches for energy management and optimization 
* Machine learning techniques for renewable energy integration 
* Predictive maintenance and fault detection in smart grids 
* AI-based solutions for energy storage and distribution 
* Case studies and real-world applications of deep learning in smart grids 

## Submission Guidelines

Proposals should include the following information: 
* Title of the tutorial 
* Abstract (max 300 words) 
* Detailed outline of the tutorial (including duration and format) 
* Speaker(s) bio(s) (max 200 words each) 
* Target audience and prerequisites 
* Any special requirements (e.g., equipment, software) 

Please submit your proposals via e-mail to g.tanoni@staff.univpm.it with the subject line “DLT-4-OSGE Tutorial Proposal”. 

We look forward to your contributions and to making this workshop a valuable and enriching experience for all participants.
